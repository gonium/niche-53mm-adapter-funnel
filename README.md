# Simple funnel: Niche to Mini Vivaldi II

I have a Niche coffee grinder and a LaSpaziale Mini Vivaldi II espresso machine -- and I love both. Sadly, the coffee cup of the Niche is made for 58mm portafilters, while the Mini Vivaldi uses a 53mm portafilter. Transferring the coffee grounds to the portafilter was just too messy.

This is a simple funnel that solves the problem. Put it upside-down on the cup with your ground coffee, and then just put the portafilter upside-down on the funnel. Flip all three over, jiggle it a bit, and all grounds will fall into the portafilter.

BASF Ultrafuse PLA (ice blue transparent). The material data sheet states that this PLA is food safe. 

## OpenSCAD

I usually don't use OpenSCAD, because it is hard to get smooth surfaces. But the "Round Anything"-Library works pretty well for this. I just define a cross-section of the funnel and extrude a full revolution.
